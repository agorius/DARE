# can you propose a series of questions that readers may ask. What would Lawmakers ask? What would automakers ask? What questions does this (high level) proposal incite?

The DARE proposal raises critical questions across stakeholder groups, reflecting its interdisciplinary challenges and opportunities:

### Lawmaker Concerns

**Regulatory \& Infrastructure**

- How will distributed generation regulations adapt to accommodate thousands of micro-power units along gas pipelines? [^2][^3]
- What safeguards ensure grid stability when deploying decentralized systems at scale? [^3][^7]
- Does prioritizing natural gas conflict with federal/state renewable energy mandates? [^2][^5]

**Environmental \& Economic**

- What carbon capture technologies are viable for ICE-powered units, and at what cost? [^1][^5]
- How does the \$1.6–\$3.3B CAPEX compare to renewable alternatives over a 10-year horizon? [^5]
- What mechanisms prevent localized emissions hotspots near pipeline-adjacent communities? [^1]


### Automaker Considerations

**Technical \& Operational**

- Can existing HVM engine lines meet the 250kW modular output without major retooling? [^6]
- How does dual-engine redundancy impact maintenance cycles compared to single-engine designs?
- What liability frameworks govern engine failures in 24/7 data center operations?

**Market Strategy**

- Does open-sourcing specifications erode competitive advantage in power module manufacturing?
- What incentives exist for automakers to pivot from EV development back to ICE production? [^4][^6]
- How will consumer perceptions of "gas-guzzling AI" impact brand reputation? [^5]


### Systemic Questions from Critics

**Scalability \& Resilience**

- Can 204,000 units be deployed by 2027 given current automotive supply chain constraints?
- How does transmission loss reduction compare to methane leakage risks in aging gas pipelines? [^1]
- What cybersecurity protocols protect decentralized units from coordinated attacks? [^7][^8]

**Energy Mix \& Innovation**

- Why prioritize ICE over emerging modular nuclear/SMR solutions for distributed AI power? [^5]
- How does DARE’s "fail-in-place" architecture address land use concerns for containerized units?
- Could open-source standards accelerate competing foreign implementations (e.g., China)? [^4][^8]

**Socioeconomic Factors**

- What workforce retraining programs are needed for ICE technicians vs. renewable energy jobs? [^3]
- How does CHP integration with small businesses avoid creating energy monopolies? [^3][^7]
- Will net metering policies sufficiently incentivize excess power contribution? [^1][^3]

These questions highlight tensions between rapid deployment needs, environmental goals, and industrial transformation – mirroring broader debates in AI energy policy [^2][^5][^7].
