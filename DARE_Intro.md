## DARE: A Detailed Introduction to Distributed AI Resilient Energy

### Powering America's AI Future with Domestic Innovation

The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence presents an unprecedented energy challenge. By 2027, AI data centers are projected to demand an astonishing **51 gigawatts (GW)** of new power, a critical surge essential for maintaining America's global tech leadership. The DARE project offers a revolutionary, decentralized power strategy to meet this demand head-on, leveraging existing American strengths.

DARE proposes a **Distributed AI Resilient Energy** solution that utilizes **high-volume manufactured (HVM) car engines** from America’s iconic automakers – Ford, GM, Dodge (Stellantis), and Tesla – to power distributed AI data centers strategically located along our existing natural gas pipelines.

### The DARE Solution: Modular, Resilient, and Efficient

Our core proposal involves modular data centers, each providing a target of **250kW of compute power**. It's important to note that this 250kW figure is a placeholder for planning purposes. We anticipate that the AI data center industry will drive the demand for power, and the automotive industry will supply the modular power units to meet that demand. The optimal size of these modular data centers will likely be determined by a combination of networking considerations, overhead requirements, fail-in-place architectures, and the time required for rapid unit replacement. We believe that 250kW currently represents a realistic and viable number of compute units to align with a leaf network switch topology operating at 100G/200G for scalable AI inference deployments.

These units are designed to be compact, housed within common shipping containers, and powered by highly reliable, (possibly) redundant natural gas internal combustion engines (ICE).

### Compelling Benefits for National Advantage:

* **Unprecedented Cost Savings:** To meet the 51 GW demand, DARE requires approximately 204,000 such 250kW units. The total capital expenditure for **power generation components alone** is dramatically reduced to an estimated **$1.6 billion to $3.3 billion**. Each 250kW power generation module is projected to cost an astonishing **$8,000 to $16,000** (or **$32 to $64 per kilowatt**). This stands in stark contrast to traditional GigaWatt-scale gas-fired plants, which typically cost $1,000 to $3,000 per kW to deploy, built around highly reliable (huge) gas turbines.
* **Rapid Deployment Capability:** This modular system significantly slashes development timelines to just **2-3 years**. This is a dramatic acceleration compared to the 3-5 years (or more) required for conventional centralized power plants and necessary grid upgrades.
* **Superior Resilience & Efficiency:** With built-in redundancy, utilizing dual natural gas engines in each container, system resilience is "basically free." Placing compute resources closer to demand points dramatically reduces transmission losses, enhances overall system reliability, and optimizes energy delivery.
* **Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Potential:** The original conception of DARE envisioned a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) approach. This would allow small businesses, colocated with natural gas and internet access, to disconnect from the grid, co-generate heat and power, and potentially feed both AI workloads and excess power back to the grid (net metering).
* **Waste Heat Recovery:** Beyond cogeneration, there are significant opportunities for waste-heat recovery as DARE deployments scale. This could further enhance efficiency and sustainability.
* **Carbon Dioxide Output as a Commodity:** CO2 can be a waste by-product, or it can be captured and repurposed as a valuable commodity for applications like greenhouse farming, where it enhances plant growth, or for industrial uses such as carbonation in beverages or chemical manufacturing. Effective carbon capture and utilization technologies can mitigate environmental impacts while creating economic opportunities.

### Open Source for Accelerated Innovation and Compatibility:

The DARE project is fundamentally open source. Specifications, designs, and methodologies are transparent and publicly accessible. This commitment to open source is critical because it fosters a collaborative environment where even competitive entities can innovate upon the core specifications while ensuring compatibility. This shared approach accelerates progress for the entire industry, encouraging diverse solutions and ultimately strengthens America's energy and AI infrastructure through collective ingenuity.

### America's Moment for Global Leadership:

The US has already demonstrated leadership in AI investment, with **$109 billion in private AI expenditure in 2024 alone**. This innovative, American-led energy solution will not only secure our technological dominance over competitors like China and Europe but also catalyze vast numbers of high-paying jobs and fuel robust stock market growth. It ingeniously transforms our robust automotive manufacturing base into a strategic national asset for the AI era.

### A Call to Action for American Leadership:

* **For Automotive Leadership:** Seize this monumental opportunity to truly "Make America Compute Again." We urge our iconic automakers – Ford, GM, Dodge (Stellantis), and Tesla – to embrace an open specification for these power modules, igniting a new, vital segment of American industry.
* **For Lawmakers:** We call for the fast-tracking of necessary regulatory frameworks to seamlessly integrate this distributed power generation with our existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure. Removing barriers to rapid deployment is essential to ensure America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution.

Let's unleash American ingenuity to create a future where our AI capabilities are powered by American hands and American innovation, ensuring our nation’s prosperity and security for generations to come. The 2028 elections will showcase the job creation and economic triumphs this vision delivers.
