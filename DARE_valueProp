# DARE: A Transformative Solution for America's AI Future

The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence presents an unprecedented energy challenge, with AI data centers projected to demand an astonishing 51 gigawatts (GW) of new power by 2027. The DARE (Distributed AI Resilient Energy) project offers a revolutionary, decentralized power strategy to meet this demand head-on, leveraging existing American strengths to ensure both technological leadership and national security.

## The DARE Solution: Modular, Resilient, and Efficient

DARE proposes a **Distributed AI Resilient Energy** solution that utilizes **high-volume manufactured (HVM) car engines** from America’s iconic automakers – Ford, GM, Dodge (Stellantis), and Tesla – to power distributed AI data centers strategically located along our existing natural gas pipelines.

Our core proposal involves modular data centers, each providing a target of **250kW of compute power**. These units are designed to be compact, housed within common shipping containers, and powered by highly reliable, (possibly) redundant natural gas internal combustion engines (ICE). Crucially, DARE is envisioned as **100% off-grid** and generates approximately **400VDC directly to the compute components, eliminating the need for bulky AC transformers**.

## Compelling Benefits for National Advantage

**Unprecedented Cost Savings:** To meet the 51 GW demand, DARE requires approximately 204,000 such 250kW units. The total capital expenditure for **power generation components alone** is dramatically reduced to an estimated **$1.6 billion to $3.3 billion**. Each 250kW power generation module is projected to cost an astonishing **$8,000 to $16,000** (or **$32 to $64 per kilowatt**). This stands in stark contrast to traditional GigaWatt-scale gas-fired plants, which typically cost $1,000 to $3,000 per kW to deploy, built around highly reliable (huge) gas turbines.

**Radical Reduction in Copper & Transformer Dependency:** DARE's 100% off-grid and 400VDC direct-to-compute architecture inherently eliminates the need for vast quantities of copper cabling and numerous large AC transformers typically required for grid connection and AC power distribution. This is critically advantageous given current market realities: a looming 50% tariff on copper imports (effective August 1, 2025) which will inflate material costs, and existing lead times of 1-3 years (or more for specialized units) for essential grid transformers, severely bottlenecking traditional infrastructure expansion. By bypassing these supply chain vulnerabilities, DARE ensures crucial technological growth is insulated from escalating commodity prices and fragile global supply chains.

**Rapid Deployment Capability:** This modular system significantly slashes development timelines to just **2-3 years**. This is a dramatic acceleration compared to the 3-5 years (or more) required for conventional centralized power plants and necessary grid upgrades.

**Superior Resilience & Efficiency:** With built-in redundancy, utilizing dual natural gas engines in each container, system resilience is "basically free." Placing compute resources closer to demand points dramatically reduces transmission losses, enhances overall system reliability, and optimizes energy delivery. The 100% off-grid operation provides unparalleled immunity to grid blackouts, brownouts, and cyberattacks, enhancing national security and data center uptime.

**Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Potential:** The original conception of DARE envisioned a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) approach. This would allow small businesses, colocated with natural gas and internet access, to disconnect from the grid, co-generate heat and power, and potentially feed both AI workloads and excess power back to the grid (net metering).

**Waste Heat Recovery:** Beyond cogeneration, there are significant opportunities for waste-heat recovery as DARE deployments scale. This could further enhance efficiency and sustainability.

**Carbon Dioxide Output as a Commodity:** CO2 can be a waste by-product, or it can be captured and repurposed as a valuable commodity for applications like greenhouse farming, where it enhances plant growth, or for industrial uses such as carbonation in beverages or chemical manufacturing. Effective carbon capture and utilization technologies can mitigate environmental impacts while creating economic opportunities.

## Open Source for Accelerated Innovation and Compatibility

The DARE project is fundamentally open source. Specifications, designs, and methodologies are transparent and publicly accessible. This commitment to open source is critical because it fosters a collaborative environment where even competitive entities can innovate upon the core specifications while ensuring compatibility. This shared approach accelerates progress for the entire industry, encouraging diverse solutions and ultimately strengthens America’s energy and AI infrastructure through collective ingenuity.

## America’s Moment for Global Leadership

The US has already demonstrated leadership in AI investment, with $109 billion in private AI expenditure in 2024 alone. This innovative, American-led energy solution will not only secure our technological dominance over competitors like China and Europe but also catalyze vast numbers of high-paying jobs and fuel robust stock market growth. It ingeniously transforms our robust automotive manufacturing base into a strategic national asset for the AI era.

## A Call to Action for American Leadership

**For Automotive Leadership:** Seize this monumental opportunity to truly "Make America Compute Again." We urge our iconic automakers – Ford, GM, Dodge (Stellantis), and Tesla – to embrace an open specification for these power modules, igniting a new, vital segment of American industry.

**For Lawmakers:** We call for the fast-tracking of necessary regulatory frameworks to seamlessly integrate this distributed power generation with our existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure. Removing barriers to rapid deployment is essential to ensure America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution.

Let’s unleash American ingenuity to create a future where our AI capabilities are powered by American hands and American innovation, ensuring our nation’s prosperity and security for generations to come. The 2028 elections will showcase the job creation and economic triumphs this vision delivers.
