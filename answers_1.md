### Some Insights and Innovations That Can Enable Lower-cost Power Generation

* **Pipeline for Energy Delivery:**
A comprehensive study comparing various energy carriers over 1,000 miles found that the amortized total cost of energy transmission by pipelines ranges from less than $1/MWh to $5/MWh. In stark contrast, the electrical transmission cost (500 kV HVDC) was reported to be above $40/MWh (equivalent to $0.04/kWh). Natural gas pipelines are often cited as having faster deployment times. For example, some Texas gas pipelines are reliably built within about 2 years of receiving permits.
**Summary Comparison (Approximate Infrastructure Cost to Deliver per GJ per 1,000 miles):**
* Natural Gas Pipeline: $0.28 - $1.39/GJ
* High Voltage Electricity: $11.11/GJ (or higher)

* **24/7/365 Generator from Auto Engine:**
  This subject is well covered, with Research and Development currently advancing the state of the art. It is well understood and can be quickly applied by engine-makers.
* Engine conversions to continuous operation: (thermal cycling, oil capacity, cooling
* Engine modifications for Natural Gas
* Maintenance changes
* Parallelization of engine/generator
* Grid Tie vs Off-Grid
